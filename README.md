- **Internationalization:** Custom translation system (PT-BR/EN-US)
- **Structure:** Backend in `backend/app/`, Frontend in `frontend/`, Database in `database/`

---

## 🏗️ Database Architecture

The project features a centralized database module with clean imports and lifecycle management, now using PostgreSQL (Neon/Render) as the only supported backend:

### Database Structure
```
database/
├── __init__.py           # Clean exports for easy imports
├── config.py             # Database configuration and engine setup
├── session.py            # Session management and dependency injection
├── models.py             # SQLAlchemy models (User, Ship, OwnedShips, etc.)
├── base_data.py          # Initial data for seeding
├── lifecycle.py          # Database initialization and health checks
├── setup.py              # Main command-line setup script
└── scripts/              # Quick utility scripts
    ├── init_db.py        # Quick initialization
    ├── seed_db.py        # Quick seeding
    └── reset_db.py       # Quick reset
```

### Database Models
- **User**: Game user accounts with ELO ranking, experience, levels, ranks, and statistics
- **Ship**: Ship templates with base characteristics (30 ships in 6 tiers)
- **OwnedShips**: Individual ships owned by users with current stats
- **BattleHistory**: Records of battles with detailed logs
- **SystemLogs**: Comprehensive audit logging for security and debugging
- **ShipyardLog**: Tracks last shipyard usage per user/ship
- **RankBonus**: Stores rank-based stat bonuses for progression system

### Database Management

You can manage the database using the provided command-line scripts. These commands allow you to initialize, seed, reset, clear, and check the health of your PostgreSQL database.

```bash
# Initialize database with sample data
python database/setup.py init --seed

# Add sample data to existing database  
python database/setup.py seed

# Reset database (drop + recreate)
python database/setup.py reset --seed

# Clear all data (keep structure)
python database/setup.py clear

# Check database health
python database/setup.py health
```

> **Note:**
> - Make sure your `DATABASE_URL` environment variable is set to your PostgreSQL connection string before running these commands.

### Clean Imports
```python
# Simple imports for common use cases
from database import get_db, User, Ship, OwnedShips
from database import initialize_database, check_database_health

# All database functionality accessible through clean interface
```

---

## 🗺️ Project Flowchart

```mermaid
flowchart LR
    User["👤 User"]
    Frontend["🌐 Frontend (React/Vite)"]
    API["🚀 FastAPI API"]
    DB["🗄️ PostgreSQL (Neon/Render)"]

    User -->|"Interacts"| Frontend
    Frontend -->|"HTTP Requests (REST, JWT)"| API
    API -->|"ORM (SQLAlchemy)"| DB
    DB -->|"Data"| API
    API -->|"JSON Response"| Frontend
    Frontend -->|"UI Update"| User
```

**Legend:**
- User: Game player (web interface)
- Frontend: React app (Vite, Tailwind)
- API: FastAPI backend (auth, business logic, REST endpoints)
- DB: PostgreSQL database (Neon/Render)

- All authentication, business logic, and data persistence flow through this pipeline.
- Logging, health checks, and admin tools interact directly with the API and database, but are not shown to the end user.

---

## 🎯 Progression System

Bellum Astrum features a comprehensive progression system that enhances gameplay through experience, levels, and military ranks.

### Experience & Levels
- **Exponential Growth**: XP requirements increase exponentially (base 100, factor 1.5)
- **Dynamic XP Gains**: Earn more XP fighting higher-level opponents, less for lower-level
- **Battle Participation**: Both winners and losers gain experience from battles
- **Level-Up Rewards**: Automatic progression checks after each battle

### Military Ranks
The game features 11 military ranks based on Fibonacci-like level requirements:

| Rank | Level Required | Stat Bonus |
|------|----------------|------------|
| Recruit | 1 | 0% |
| Ensign | 3 | 5% |
| Lieutenant | 5 | 10% |
| Lieutenant Commander | 8 | 15% |
| Commander | 13 | 20% |
| Captain | 21 | 25% |
| Commodore | 35 | 30% |
| Rear Admiral | 55 | 35% |
| Vice Admiral | 89 | 40% |
| Admiral | 144 | 50% |
| Fleet Admiral | 233 | 60% |

### Rank Bonuses
Rank bonuses apply multiplicatively to all ship stats during battles:
- **Attack**: Increased damage output
- **Shield**: Enhanced defensive capabilities
- **HP**: Additional health points
- **Evasion**: Improved dodge chance
- **Fire Rate**: Faster attack speed
- **Value**: Higher ship worth

### NPC System
11 NPCs distributed across different ranks provide balanced opposition:
- **Balanced Economy**: NPCs don't gain or lose currency
- **Ship Restoration**: NPC ships auto-repair after battles
- **ELO Protection**: Only human players gain/lose ELO against NPCs
- **Progressive Challenge**: NPCs scale from Recruit to Fleet Admiral
